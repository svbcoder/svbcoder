Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm a Full Stack web developer and certified Microsoft AI Engineer.
 
ðŸ’¬ I enjoy mentoring students and supporting others with their projects or applications. <br>
ðŸ”­ I have participated in Solana Grizzlython Online Hackathon in 2023. Built an AI NFT Minting application with team. https://solana.com/news/solana-grizzlython-winners.<br>
ðŸŒ± Always learning â€” right now, Iâ€™m exploring GPT-5 and its broader applications while dabbling in ML, Robotics use cases in real-life.<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on remote freelance software engineering projects.<br>

ðŸ“œ My journey: 
- Iâ€™m a self-taught developer, shaped by more than five years of relentless coding as a self-sponsored side hustle.
- Alongside that, I bring 24 years of full-time corporate experience as a Project Manager and PMO in technology and business, especially in the financial services domain.
- Separately, I also founded and ran an IT consulting business in Japan (boot-strapped), building it from the ground up with family and friends. I handled everything from operations to client engagement, sales, reaching breakeven, and eventually closing the business on my own terms after 3 years of successful operation.
